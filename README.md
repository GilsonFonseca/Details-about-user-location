# Details-about-user-location
The idea of this project is to obtain the location's details of an user using javascript.
For this I used a google's API to retrieve his location from the coordinates that I access by the navigator.
After that, it set the user's location with a marker in google's map, and lastly it calculates the distance between the user and a specified location.
